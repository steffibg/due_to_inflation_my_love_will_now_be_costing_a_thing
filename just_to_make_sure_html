          Every time I receive a payment, I will pluck a daisy and record the result.
          If the video ends with "I love you", you'll get a letter. If not, I keep the 1.77€.
        </p>

        <p>
          The 1.77€ will eventually cover the cost of buying custom postage stamps inspired by Jennifer Lopez,
          a motif I chose because of a meme she posted on Instagram that said
          "due to inflation my love will now be costing a thing", alluding to her 2001 hit
          "Love Don't Cost a Thing" and the current economic crisis in America.
        </p>

        <p>
          Basically, I want to take the meme seriously:
          For now, the offer is limited to 20 love letters and only available to people who live
          in Germany. At the moment there are still 19 letters left !
