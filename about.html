      every time I receive a payment, I will pluck a daisy and record the result<br />
      If the video ends with "I love you", you'll get a letter. If not, I keep the 1.77€<br />
      <br />
      The 1.77€ will eventually cover the cost of buying custom Jennifer Lopez postage stamps, <br />
      a motif I chose because of a meme she posted that said "due to inflation my love will <br />
      now be costing a thing", alluding to her 2001 hit "love don't cost a thing" & the current <br />
      economic crisis in America.<br />
      <br />
      Basically, I want to take the meme seriously:<br />
      For now, the offer is limited to 20 love letters and only available to people who live<br />
      in Germany. At the moment there are still 20 letters left !
