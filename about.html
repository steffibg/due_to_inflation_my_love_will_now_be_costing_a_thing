        Every time I receive a payment, I will pluck a daisy and record the result.
        If the video ends with "I love you", you'll get a letter. If not, I keep the 1.77€.
      </p>

      <p>
        The 1.77€ will eventually cover the cost of buying custom Jennifer Lopez postage stamps,
        a motif I chose because of a meme she posted on Instagram that said
        "due to inflation my love will now be costing a thing", alluding to her 2001 hit
        "Love Don't Cost a Thing" and the current economic crisis in America.
      </p>

      <p>
        Basically, I want to take the meme seriously.
        For now, the offer is limited to 20 love letters and only available to people who live
        in Germany. At the moment there are still 20 letters left!
